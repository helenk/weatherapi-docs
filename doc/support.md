## Mailing list

Please follow our mailinglist to get important news updates about the service.
This is this is the *only channel* on which we will communicate planned changes
outside the API itself (see the [archives](http://lists.met.no/pipermail/api-users/)
for past notifications).

Subscribe by following the instructions on [the list page](http://lists.met.no/mailman/listinfo/api-users),
or by sending an email to <api-users-request@lists.met.no> with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Subscription implies consent to store your email address (and optionally name) for GDPR purposes.
You can unsubscribe at any time, in which case your personal data will be deleted.

## RSS feeds

You can also get news updates via RSS feeds.

### News

News (blog) articles are listed on [/weatherapi/news]. These are more or less the
same as the mailing list messages, but are published later (usually after the change
has been implemented).

### Changelog

Change logs for all products are found in [/weatherapi/changelog]. Here you will
get a list of all the changes for each product. These are usually non-breaking
minor changes which is not announced on the mailing list.
