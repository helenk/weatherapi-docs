# MET WeatherAPI documentation documentation

This repo contains (at some point in the future) most of the docs on
api.met.no which are not autogenerated from module POD or metadata.

The content is designed primarily to be shown at
[https://api.met.no/doc/](https://api.met.no/doc/),
but is also visible for debugging purposes at
[https://metno.github.io/weatherapi-docs/doc/locationforecast/HowTO](https://metno.github.io/weatherapi-docs/doc/locationforecast/HowTO)

It is also possible to add documents intended for export
to the [Yr Developer Portal](https://developer.yr.no/).

## Organization

Structure the information according to the [Divio Documentation
System](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/).
Documentation should fall into one of the following categories:

Tutorials

- Purpose: learning
- Aim: allow the newcomer to get started

How-to guides

- Purpose: step-by-step instructions
- Aim: show how to solve a specific problem

Reference

- Purpose: looking up specific information
- Aim: describe the machinery

Explanation

- Purpose: deeper understanding
- Aim: explain complex problems

All articles should be marked with the corresponding tag in the YAML preamble.

## File structure

The files are organized as illustrated:

```
    weatherapi-docs/
    ├── doc
    │   └── locationforecast
    ├── _layouts
    ├── _posts
    ├── schemas
    ├── _site
    └── README.md
```

This is a typical Jekyll structure, with blog articles in `_posts`,
HTML templates in `_layouts` and so on. The `_site` folder is used by Jekyll
for auto-generating HTML and is excluded in `.gitignore`.

API static documentation pages shown under [https://api.met.no/doc/](/doc) on
api.met.no reside in the `doc` directory for historical reasons (yes, this means
the directory path looks somewhat strange).

Files which are not intended to be processed as Markdown but still included
in WeatherAPI may be stored in other directories. E.g. `schemas` contain the XML
schemas used on
[schema.api.met.no](https://schema.api.met.no/schemas/).
This may be added to in the future, e.g. for microservice metadata.


## Format

Markdown must adhere to the sub/superset supported by
[Text::MultiMarkdown](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown).

### YAML preamble

All documentation must start with metadata in YAML format, like this:

    ---
    title: Heading of document (do not write this in the body text)
    date: when you wrote it
    author: your name
    layout: page (for docs) or post (for blog)
    summary: >
        A short description of the subject matter (used on developer.yr.no)
    ---


### Headings

Use only level 2 headings and below, since level 1 is used for the document title.

### Code blocks

For some reason, grave-defined blocks don't work in the API, use 4-space indents instead.
Also we have not implemented syntax highlighting, so there is no point in using the former.

    # this works

        {
            "foo": "bar"
        }

    # this doesn't

    ```json
    {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
    ```

### Links

Do not write "click *here* for more information" as it is considered
[bad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#Link_best_practices)
[practice](https://www.wordpress-web-designer-raleigh.com/2015/04/4-reasons-to-avoid-using-click-here-in-link-text/).


Since text can be displayed under many different subdomains, all links must
be [root-relative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/htmlweb.html#h-5.1.2),
e.g.

    ... see [locationforecast](/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/) for info.
