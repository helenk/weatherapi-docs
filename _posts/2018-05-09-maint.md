On Monday May 14th, 2018 from 07:00 to 13:00 UTC we will be running at 50%
capacity due to replacement of the cooling system in one of our data
centers. All services are expected to continue running, but latency times
and timeout errors may increase due to reduced capacity.

Also, as has been noted earlier, the domains **api.yr.no** and
**beta.api.met.no** will be turned off on June 11th, 2018.
Please switch your systems to use api.met.no instead.
