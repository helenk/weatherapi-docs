Due to licensing issues, problems with authentication and abuse of the
service we have been forced to suspend delivery of
non-restricted geosatellite images to the general public. Currently
there are only 8 unrestricted pictures from a total of 2162 which we
are allowed to distribute freely, but we have seen repeated attempts
to download images which are clearly documented as not publicly
available. Until further notice the service will only be available
for our own sites yr.no and halo.met.no.

Also, as part of the European General Data Protection Regulations,
we have updated the privacy policy for all our sites and services.
You can find the new text under
[Privacy Policy Statement for MET Norway](https://www.met.no/en/About-us/privacy).
